# panic-lab

## Introduction

This project aims to get me into developing using Rust. 

## What is this project about?

I played a board game called Panic Lab! and thought that it would be a good idea to make a validator for the game.

## Goals

- Explore/learn rust
- Have a working validator so next time I play the game I can check the result using this app.
- Have fun! Either by playing but also while developing the app :D
